title: "targetDART project poster accepted for ISC'24"
---

We are delighted that our project poster will be on display at ISC'24 in Hamburg in May 2024. It will show how targetDART explores a task-based approach for extreme-scale simulation software to mitigate
non-predictable dynamic load imbalance by dynamically adaptive and reactive (re-)distribution of
tasks between compute nodes. targetDART extends the widely adopted MPI+OpenMP programming model and addresses exascale architectures that combine multiple heterogeneous processors (CPUs, GPUs, etc.) per node.
