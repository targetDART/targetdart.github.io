title: "Coding Week and Project Meeting"
---

From July 18 to July 20, we had our first Coding Week. All technical staff came together in Stuttgart to do intensive code reviews and to discuss implementation alternatives as well as parallisation strategies. Finally, we made significant progress towards finalizing initial interfaces for an upcoming milestone.

Below is a picture of (most) of the team in front of HLRS' ancient Cray II.
