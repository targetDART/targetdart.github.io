### Dr. Jose Garcia
<img src="../assets/Team/Garcia.jpg" />
Together with his research group, José Gracia works on topics around scalable programming models and tools. This includes, in particular, new approaches for MPI and task-based programming models and their interoperability. Furthermore, he works on tools for performance analysis, characterisation of application performance and optimisation of scientific codes and workflows.

Dr Gracia also participates in user support and is responsible for part of the HLRS software installation.

He holds a PhD in physics with a focus in numerical simulation of astrophysical flows.

## Project Members
### Christian Siebert
<img src="../assets/Team/Siebert.jpg" />
Christian Siebert studied computer science and specialised in high-performance computing. He then worked for NEC's Research Lab in the HPC team and further developed their proprietary MPI implementation. He was also actively involved in MPI standardisation, e.g. non-blocking collective MPI operations.

At RWTH Aachen he lectured on parallel programming and concentrated on the development of new scalable algorithms, e.g. for sorting and shuffling. At HHU Düsseldorf, he provided HPC user support and also led the nationwide effort in this area.

At HLRS, Siebert is preparing applications for the exascale era.
